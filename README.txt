This collection of python scripts can be used to simulate a random bit signal in time. 
The collection consists of three files:
- Config.toml: is a configuration file in which a wide varierty of link variables and signal settings can be set.
- functions_classes.py: is a file containing classes and functions that work under the hood to generate the plots, and perform the calculations
- simulation.py: is the file that runs the simulation
- Run the files on python version > 3.12 and ensure all packages are installed
